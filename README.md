#  Airline Reservation System  

##  Problem Statement  
The project **Airline Reservation System** is designed to simulate a simple airline booking process.  
It allows passengers to search for flights, book seats, make payments (via Card or UPI), and generate boarding passes.  
The system demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** such as **inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism**, along with **exception handling** and **utility classes**.  

---

##  Features  
- Flight management (add/display flights & available seats)  
- Passenger registration  
- Seat booking with confirmation/cancellation  
- Payment processing (Card/UPI)  
- Boarding pass generation  
- Exception handling for invalid inputs  
- Clean modular code with packages (`model`, `exception`, `util`, `main`)  



##  How to Compile & Run  

### **1. Clone the repository**
